      <p>
        Welcome, I am Zane Derrod, from San Diego, who has been on an
        educational journey that started at the halls of Eastlake High School
        and now finds me as a freshman at Occidental College, here I am pursuing
        my aspiration of becoming a distinguished software engineer. While in
        pursuit of these aspirations I am proudly representing Occidental
        College on the NCAA Water Polo team. This transformative experience has
        given me with a profound understanding of time management, the art of
        teamwork, and the ability to excel in high-pressure environments, all of
        which I am ready to use in the ever-changing field of technology.
      </p>
      <h3 class="compsci">How I Got Into Computer Science</h3>
      <p>
        The history behind my passion for computer science can be traced back to
        my sophomore year of high school when I embarked on my first game design
        class. It was during this pivotal moment that I first delved into the
        world of basic block coding on Scratch—a moment that would shape my
        future. What began as a modest introduction soon blossomed into a
        deep-seated fascination with the intricate world of coding. The allure
        of transforming abstract concepts into tangible realities ignited a
        relentless pursuit of knowledge within me. The boundless potential to
        make a lasting impact on the world continues to fuel my enthusiasm.
        Since that formative experience, my journey has been marked by an
        insatiable thirst for knowledge as I've explored diverse facets of the
        field, mastering various programming languages, and employing an array
        of software tools to craft three noteworthy projects.
      </p>
      <h3 class="hobbies">Hobbies</h3>
      <p>
        Beyond the realm of academics and professional pursuits, my life unfolds
        with a passion for coding and a commitment to staying up to date on the
        latest advancements in AI and software development. In addition to my
        dedication to these intellectual pursuits, I am deeply passionate about
        water polo—a sport that has commanded my devotion for several years.
        Outside the pool, cherished moments spent in the company of friends and
        family hold a special place in my heart, as I place great value on the
        enduring bonds we share. On beautiful days, there's nothing I love more
        than heading to the beach, catching some waves with my surfboard, and
        basking in the sun.
